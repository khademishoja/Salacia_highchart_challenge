About Challenge
I have developed the chart component for the challenge presented by Salacia Solutions.

The main objective of this implementation is to visually represent JSON data that consists of three levels of objects:
* Scope
* Category
* Individual activities

To achieve this, I utilized the React framework along with high chart libraries. The resulting implementation features a three-level drill-down chart that fetches data from a JSON object, allowing users to select from a variety of chart types
