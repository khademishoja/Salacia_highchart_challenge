For this project, I chose to use the React framework to display JSON
        data on charts using the Highcharts library. React made it easy to build
        a user interface that is dynamic and interactive. With Highcharts, I was
        able to create visually appealing charts to represent the data. By
        combining React and Highcharts, I created a seamless user experience
        that allows users to easily understand the data through charts. React
        helped me handle the data efficiently, while Highcharts provided a
        variety of chart types and customization options to make the charts look
        great and interactive. The integration of React and Highcharts was a
        powerful combination that allowed me to create a scalable and robust
        solution. React's component-based approach made it easy to organize and
        maintain the code, and Highcharts gave me the tools to create beautiful
        charts.
